		<h1>Investing</h1>
		<p>
			This article is a summary of what I've learned from one
			of my favourite resources for learning about investing.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you want to watch the original material you can find
			it on
			<a href="https://www.buffettsbooks.com/" target="_blank"
				>buffettsbooks.com</a
			>
		</p>
		<p>
			This article will be structured in the same way as the
			original material to help with easy referencing. This
			article is as much for me as a reference as it is for
			you the reader to get a concise summary of the courses.
			This by no means is a replacement for watching courses
			yourself and doing practice excercises. I would highly
			recommend following along with it if you want the full
			benefit.
