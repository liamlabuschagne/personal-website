			This article is a summary of what I've learned from one

			This article will be structured in the same way as the
			original material to help with easy referencing. This
			article is as much for me as a reference as it is for
			you, the reader, to get a concise summary of the
			courses. This by no means is a replacement for watching
			the courses yourself and doing practice excercises. I
			would highly recommend following along with it if you
			want the full benefit.

		<h2>Lesson 1: What is Value Investing</h2>
		<p>
			This lesson discussed the differences between value
			trading and value investing.
		</p>
		<p>
			Value trading is described as buying something that
			maintains its value and then trying to sell that later
			to someone for more money. Value investing involves
			buying assets which both increase in value as well as
			put money in your pocket. A liability on the other hand
			will decrease in value and/or take money out of your
			pocket.
		</p>
		<p>
			A house is not an asset by this definition since it only
			maintains its value (it may increase in price purely due
			to inflation) and takes money out of your pocket. In New
			Zealand this sentence is considered a sin because many
			people swear by propery investing but this is really
			just speculation. The house is still the same (or even
			worse if not maintained) after 10 years as when you
			bought it.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can make a house an asset by buying it at a
			reasonable price, renting it out and ensuring that a
			combination of capital gains and rental income covers
			your expenses for holding that asset over the long term.
			So in other words, over the long term (maybe after 20
			years or so) this will start putting money into your
			pocket in the form of surplus rental income once the
			mortgage is paid down significantly. You could also
			structure the debt using various techniques to ensure a
			positive cash flow from outset. I won't say more on this
			here since the article is not primarily focused on
			property investing.
