		<p>
			This article will be structured in the same way as the
			original material to help with easy referencing. This
			article is as much for me as a reference as it is for
			you, the reader, to get a concise summary of the
			courses. This by no means is a replacement for watching
			the courses yourself and doing practice excercises. I
			would highly recommend following along with it if you
			want the full benefit.

		<h2>Lesson 1: What is Value Investing</h2>
		<p>
			This lesson discussed the differences between value
			trading and value investing.
		</p>
		<p>
			Value trading is described as buying something that
			maintains its value and then trying to sell that later
			to someone for more money. Value investing involves
			buying assets which both increase in value as well as
			put money in your pocket. A liability on the other hand
			will decrease in value and/or take money out of your
			pocket.
		</p>
		<p>
			A house is not an asset by this definition since it only
			maintains its value (it may increase in price purely due
			to inflation) and takes money out of your pocket. In New
			Zealand this sentence is considered a sin because many
			people swear by propery investing but this is really
			just speculation. The house is still the same (or even
			worse if not maintained) after 10 years as when you
			bought it.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can make a house an asset by buying it at a
			reasonable price, renting it out and ensuring that a
			combination of capital gains and rental income covers
			your expenses for holding that asset over the long term.
			So in other words, over the long term (maybe after 20
			years or so) this will start putting money into your
			pocket in the form of surplus rental income once the
			mortgage is paid down significantly. You could also
			structure the debt using various techniques to ensure a
			positive cash flow from the outset. I won't say more on
			this here since the article is not primarily focused on
			property investing.
		</p>

		<h2>Lesson 2: Value a Small Business</h2>
		<p>
			Businesses bring in revenue, pay expenses, what's left
			is the net income. Usually at this point a business will
			pay taxes on that net income and then the owner of the
			business can either invest this income back into the
			business or take it out.
		</p>
		<p>
			A large business is exactly the same except that it has
			a board of directors which represent the shareholders,
			and all the employees including the CEO work for the
			shareholders because they own the business.
		</p>
		<p>
			The value of a business is largely dependent on what
			people will pay for it. The more you pay for a business,
			the lower your return will be. If you bought a business
			for $1 and it made $1 of net income for the year, you
			would have made a 100% return. Double or halve the
			purchase price and you halve or double the return.
		</p>

		<h2>Lesson 3: What is a Balance Sheet</h2>
		<p>
			This is one of the three financial statements which
			describes the assets and liabilities of the business.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the previous lesson we were essentially discussing
			the income statement where the main output figure is net
			income. In this case, equity is the main output figure
			being assets minus liabilities.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you evenly divide a company into pieces called shares
			the equity in that piece would be called book value.
		</p>
		<p>
			The closer the purchase price is to the equity, the
			safer the investment because more of your investment
			could be recovered just by selling the assets of the
			business.
		</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h2>Lesson 4: What is a Share?</h2>
		<p>
			A share is an equal sized piece of a company. If you own
			one share, you own that portion of the business. Since
			you really do own part of the business, you also own the
			equity in the business and have a right to the net
			income of the business.
		</p>
		<p>
			Each share has a book value (equity) and earnings (net
			income) which are simply terms for the same main outputs
			of the financial statements but on a per share basis.
		</p>
		<p>
			The price to earnings ratio describes what the market
			price for a share is compared to its earnings. If a
			company has a P/E of 5 that means "for every $5 I pay
			buying this business, I expect to earn $1 a year later".
		</p>
		<p>
			Whether you buy the whole business or just one share,
			the proportions are the same so always run the numbers
			using ratios and percentages rather that nominal
			figures.

		<h2>Lesson 5: Warren Buffett Stock Basics</h2>
		<p>Warren Buffett has four rules in investing.</p>
		<p>
			Firstly, the company has to be stable and understandable
			otherwise it's simply not possible to predict the future
			of the company.
		</p>
		<p>
			Secondly, the company must have long term prospects
			because buying and holding a company will save you fees,
			taxes and time over your investing career
		</p>
		<p>
			Third, the business must be managed by vigiliant
			leaders. The only way to assess this is to look at debt
			levels and how well the company reinvests its income if
			it decides to not to pay it out to the owners.
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally, the business must be undervalued because over
			paying for even the best business will result in poor
			returns.
		</p>
		<p>
			A quick way to screen a company when looking for an
			investment is the following: P/E * P/BV &lt; 22.5
		</p>
		<p>
			Take the P/E ratio (return) and the price to book value
			ratio (P/BV which represents safety) and multiply them
			together ensuring the result is less than 22.5. This is
			equivalent to a P/E of less than 15 and a P/BV of less
			than 1.5.
		</p>
		<p>
			Remember that the market is just there offering you
			prices every day and doesn't represent the value of the
			company.
		</p>
		<p>
			Be patient (this is a slow and boring process) and think
			critically (if it was really as easy as copying your
			neighbours stock picks, everyone would be doing it).
