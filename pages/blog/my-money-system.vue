    <h1>My Money System</h1>
    <p>
      This article explains a system that I've developed for managing money and
      ultimately helping achieve what I want out of life. Money isn't everything
      and it certainly should not be our main focus but it is a useful tool and
      it should be handled well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally, I like to run my personal finances like a business where
      (financially) the goal is to increase my savings rate (profit) and my net
      worth (equity). Your savings rate is the difference between your income
      and expenses whilst your net worth is the difference between what you own
      (assets) and what you owe (liabilities).
    </p>
    <p>
      The motivation for these is firstly to be a good steward of the resources
      given to me by God and secondly to be prepared financially for everything
      life has to offer whether good or bad. This is elsewhere known as
      financial independence which is something you want to achieve before you
      retire at least and earlier if possible.

    <h2>Earning</h2>
    <p>
      For this system to work, you will need to decide on a single monthly
      income number even if your income is variable. The system will accommodate
      for fluctuations but this number will be the basis of spending and saving
      calculations so choose a conservative amount (e.g a low average).
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important that all your income is deposited into your central
      account which is just any bank account that gives you all the features you
      need with minimal fees.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Spending</h2>
    <p>
      In this system, all expenses are one of two types, each paid for from a
      separate account.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Automatic</strong>: Bills, subscriptions and transfers
        regardless of whether they are a fixed amount or vary each month
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Manual:</strong> Purchases you make on a card or transfers you
        initiate in real time
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Central account:</strong> All automatic expenses will come out of
      your central account. For variable automatic expenses, make a conservative
      estimate (higher rather than lower) to come up with a fixed amount. You
      should be able to easily sum these up to get a single total per month.
    </p>
    <p>
      Subtracting this amount from from your income leaves your spending
      allowance. Setup a recurring transfer for this amount from your central to
      your spending account, treating it like another automatic expense.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Spending account:</strong> Spend this allowance freely on anything
      you need or want knowing that all automatic bills will be paid regardless.
      You should budget by time not by category. For example, if you're half way
      through the month and have less than half your allowance left, try to rein
      in your spending.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Buffers:</strong> A one month buffer in each transactional account
      will handle any deviations from the planned amounts and mean you are
      always paying this months expenses with last months income. Less expensive
      months will increase the buffer and more expensive months will consume
      this increase to create a fairly consistent average.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Maintenance:</strong> At the start of every month, top up the
      buffers from your savings account if needed. If your buffers are
      increasing consistently, just increase your savings contribution or your
      spending allowance, don't do more transfers than are necessary.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Saving</h2>
    <p>
      In this system, savings are treated like any other automatic expense.
      Setup a recurring transfer from your central account to your savings
      account for a fixed amount each month. This amount will directly reduce
      your spending allowance so choose a realistic amount and commit to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Future expenses list:</strong> Some expenses are not able to be
      easily absorbed by your spending allowance so they can be saved for ahead
      of time by noting the amount and when they are due in a list. These can
      then be drawn from savings just before paying for them from the spending
      account or at the monthly maintenance session if the expense is automatic
      and will come out of the central account.
    </p>
    <p>
      For unplanned but necessary expenses or in case you lose your income, you
      will also need some savings set aside, note this on the list as a single
      sum, it will act as a floor for your savings account. This can be
      estimated based on historical trends or otherwise 3-12 months of living
      expenses based on how stable and secure your income is.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Saving for the list:</strong> Based on the list produced, a total
      required amount should be calculated. Subtracting this from the current
      balance will reveal either a surplus or deficit for these future expenses
      when forecasting future savings contributions.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a surplus, this can be allocated to future spending by adding more
      items to the list or reducing the savings rate to allow for a higher
      spending allowance.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a deficit, a forecast should be made to determine if the current
      savings rate will be sufficient to cover these costs when they arise
      otherwise less important expenses should be removed or scaled down or the
      savings rate increased, reducing the spending allowance.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Investing:</strong> If there is a surplus and all known future
      expenses have been accounted for, the savings contribution should be
      redirected to a higher performing investment like a shares portfolio which
      can be contributed to automatically every month.
    </p>
    <p>
      Investing should should be done along side regular savings since it will
      produce a better return than cash and can one day be used to subsidise or
      fully fund your lifestyle. This is done by amassing a large enough
      portfolio such that the yearly returns are larger than your required
      withdrawals. A good target is 25 times your annual expenses which
      represents a 4% withdrawal rate.
