    <h1>My Money System</h1>
    <p>
      This article will explain exactly how I manage my money in every aspect
      from earning, spending and saving. Particularly, I'll explain how I've
      setup my financial accounts and how I use them in every situation.
    </p>

    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <p>
      Before I start, I'd like to set out some requirements for this money
      system (as I am an engineer after all), which will be used to justify the
      decisions I make about its design as I develop it throughout this article.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Simplicity</strong>: It should be easy to use and easy to
        understand in my head without any complex diagrams or explanations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Efficiency</strong>: I want to spend as little time and energy
        managing my money as possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Versatile</strong>: The system should be flexible and robust
        enough to handle all life stages and unpredictable events without major
        adaptations.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Earning, Spending and Saving</h2>
    <p>
      Next, I want to layout my philosophy of money and all the ways it can be
      used. Obviously, to get money you need to earn it in some form usually
      referred to as income. You then have expenses necessary to keep you alive
      and to get enjoyment out of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      What's left over is not savings, savings is an explicit choice to set
      aside money for your future self. Money not spent but also not explicitly
      saved will be spent eventually. This is also why getting a discount on an
      item is not saving money because you will likely still spend that money
      somewhere else.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Assets, Liabilities and Equity</h2>
    <p>
      Just as a business has things it owns and amounts it owes, so do we. Whats
      left is called equity, also known as net worth in personal finance terms
      (which is an unfortunate framing but people understand this).
    </p>
    <p>
      Money explicitly saved and not spent is the only way to increase your net
      worth in a way you fully control. This is unlike paying down debt where
      your liabilities are reduced but so are your assets, the difference
      between the two has not changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only other way your net worth (or equity) changes is if the value of
      your assets increase, but this is not something you can really control, so
      it should not be focused on. It is more important to focus on accumulating
      assets with the money you explicitly save.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Why strive for net worth?</h2>
    <p>
      Financially speaking, net worth is the only number that matters in the
      long term. If you make a trillion dollars a year but also spend a trillion
      dollars that's money you'll never get back and at the end of that year you
      will have nothing to show for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is important because income is not guaranteed and some day it will
      come to an end (either by choice or by force) yet you still need it to
      live. Therefore having some money set aside to live on in the future is
      vital and it gives you more choices in life.
    </p>

    <h2>Bank Accounts</h2>
    <p>
      Below I've named the three accounts you will need for this system and what
      type of account they are.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Central account (Transactional)</li>
      <li>Spending account (Transactional)</li>
      <li>Savings account (Savings)</li>
    </ol>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Earning</h2>
    <p>
      For this system to work, you will need to decide on a single monthly
      income number even if your income is variable. The system will accommodate
      for fluctuations but this number will be the basis of spending and saving
      calculations so choose a conservative amount (e.g low average).
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Spending</h2>
    <p>
      In this system, all expenses are one of two types, each paid for from a
      separate account.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Automatic</strong>: Bills, subscriptions and transfers
        regardless of whether they are a fixed amount or vary each month
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Manual:</strong> Purchases you make on a card or transfers you
        initiate in real time
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Central account:</strong> All automatic expenses will come out of
      your central account. For variable automatic expenses, make a conservative
      estimate (higher rather than lower) to come up with a fixed amount. You
      should be able to easily sum these up to get a single total per month.
    </p>
    <p>
      Subtracting this amount from from your income leaves your spending
      allowance. Setup a recurring transfer for this amount from your central to
      your spending account, treating it like another automatic expense.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Spending account:</strong> Spend this allowance freely on anything
      you need or want knowing that all automatic bills will be paid regardless.
      You should budget by time not by category. For example, if you're half way
      through the month and have less than half your allowance left, try to rein
      in your spending.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Buffers</h2>
    <p>
      A one month buffer in each transactional account will handle any
      deviations from the planned amounts and mean you are always paying this
      months expenses with last months income. Less expensive months will
      overflow the buffer and more expensive months will consume this overflow
      to create a fairly consistent average.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Saving</h2>
    <p>
      In this system, savings are treated like any other automatic expense.
      Setup a recurring transfer from your central account to your savings
      account for a fixed amount each month. This amount will directly reduce
      your spending allowance so choose a realistic amount and commit to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some expenses are not able to be easily absorbed by a spending allowance
      so they can be saved for ahead of time by noting the amount and when they
      are due in a list. These can then be drawn from savings before paying for
      them from the spending account or at the monthly maintenance session if
      needed in the central account.
    </p>
    <p>
      For unplanned, necessary expenses or in the case that you lose your income
      you will also need some savings set aside, note this on the list as a
      single sum, it will act as a floor for the savings account. This can be
      estimated based on historical trends or otherwise 3-12 months of living
      expenses based on how stable and secure your income is.
    </p>
    <p>
      Based on the list produced, a total required amount should be calculated.
      Subtracting this from the current balance will reveal either a surplus or
      deficit for these future expenses when forecasting future savings
      contributions.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a surplus, this can be allocated to future spending by adding more
      items to the list or reducing the savings rate to allow for a higher
      spending allowance.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a deficit, a forecast should be made to determine if the current
      savings rate will be sufficient to cover these costs when they arise
      otherwise less important expenses should be removed or scaled down or the
      savings rate increased, reducing the spending allowance.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Maintenance</h2>
    <p>
      At the start of every month, top up the buffers from your savings account
      if needed. If your buffers are increasing consistently, just increase your
      savings contribution or your spending allowance, don't do more transfers
      than are necessary.
