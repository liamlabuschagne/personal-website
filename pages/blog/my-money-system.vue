    <h1>My Money System</h1>
    <p>
      In this article I'll try to explain from some guiding principles how I
      manage my money including bank accounts, investment accounts, KiwiSaver
      and more. At each step I'll provide an overview of the options and justify
      my choice of one of them. By each step I mean I'll build my system from
      the ground up making adjustments as I go.

    <h2>Step 1: Income</h2>
    <p>
      This might seem too basic but I think it more accurately aligns with my
      process. I'm starting with income because for most of us, if not all of
      us, we need money to survive. Even in retirement, where ever it may come
      from whether it be from the government, a pension or investments, an
      income is a helpful way of managing our money because it creates a useful
      rhythm or pace for consumption.

    <p>
      The alternative here would be to have a huge pot of money (whether in cash
      or bank deposits) and slowly spend this down over the course of our lives.
      An obvious problem with this is, firstly that most people don't have a
      huge pot of money just lying around, at least not when they first start
      out in life and secondly, what happens if you run out of money before you
      die? So for this reason I'm assuming your system will also involve a
      source or sources of income.

    <h2>Step 2: A Bank Account</h2>
    <p>
      Why do we have bank accounts? One reason might be that our employer would
      rather deposit money directly into a bank account rather than hand over a
      wad of cash every month for everyone to see, keeping in mind that this is
      the reality for many people around the world, how cool would that be?
