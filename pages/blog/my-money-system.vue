    <h1>My Money System</h1>
    <p>
      In this article I'll try to explain from some guiding principles how I
      manage my money including bank accounts, investment accounts, KiwiSaver
      and more. At each step I'll provide an overview of the options and justify
      my choice of one of them. By each step I mean I'll build my system from
      the ground up making adjustments as I go.
    </p>

    <h2>Part 1: Income</h2>
    <p>
      This might seem too basic but I think it more accurately aligns with my
      process. I'm starting with income because for most of us, if not all of
      us, we need money to survive. Even in retirement, where ever it may come
      from whether it be from the government, a pension or investments, an
      income is a helpful way of managing our money because it creates a useful
      rhythm or pace for consumption.
    </p>
    <p>
      The alternative here would be to have a huge pot of money (whether in cash
      or bank deposits) and slowly spend this down over the course of our lives.
      An obvious problem with this is, firstly that most people don't have a
      huge pot of money just lying around, at least not when they first start
      out in life and secondly, what happens if you run out of money before you
      die? So for this reason I'm assuming your system will also involve a
      source or sources of income.
    </p>

    <h2>Part 2: A Bank Account</h2>
    <p>
      Why do we have bank accounts? One reason might be that our employer would
      rather deposit money directly into a bank account rather than hand over a
      wad of cash every month for everyone to see, keeping in mind that this is
      the reality for many people around the world, how cool would that be?
      Walking away after each day's work with the money in hand.
    </p>
    <h3>Pay Frequency</h3>
    <p>
      That brings up the question around frequency of pay. Around the world, how
      frequently people get paid changes based on employment laws. Normally,
      companies prefer to pay as infrequently as possible because it reduces
      overheads involved with administration, especially having 12 fixed dates
      in a year as opposed to bi-weekly pay for example which gets complicated
      when you have leap years or months with 3 pay periods. For employees,
      being paid more frequently is preferred because it helps to manage cash
      flow. You can read more about this on

    <h3>Business Mindset</h3>
    <p>
      Companies however usually use an invoicing model whereby goods or services
      delivered in one month are due to paid for the following month on a set
      day like the 20th. As a partly self-employed person, I've adopted this
      mindset because it makes you less reliant on the income coming in and
      forces you to be more disciplined and have longer term thinking going from
      a weekly mindset to a monthly or quarterly way of thinking. Additionally,
      it means you don't stress about overspending in a short time period like a
      week because you know that over a 3 month period everything should even
      out with some months being less busy others following the natural ebbs and
      flows of life.
    </p>

    <h2>Part 3: Expenses</h2>
    <p>
      It would be nice to have a world where every month you earn income and it
      just piles up over time but we do have living costs to cover. You can
      think of this as the cost of doing business, everyone has to sleep
      somewhere, eat something and wear something and of course we pay taxes
      along the way on everything as well.
    </p>
    <h3>Forms of Payment</h3>
    <p>
      Most people think of paying for something as a real time transaction where
      you pull out some cash, a card or initiate a bank transfer but in our
      modern world we pay for things in so many other ways as well. For example,
      your mortgage might be gobbled up by the bank as soon as you get paid and
      you don't even have to do anything or remember to pay it, that's called a
      direct debit, the company has the ability to directly pull money out of
      your bank account.
    </p>
    <p>
      You might also have a regular payment setup from your account which
      automatically pays your rent or another bill. Finally, some companies
      prefer you to pay with a debit or credit card since they can charge the
      card whenever they want and don't have to chase you up about late payment,
      instead just cutting off services.
    </p>
    <h3>Missing a Payment</h3>
    <p>
      Because of the sheer number of payments and lack of innovation in banking
      software it can be difficult to keep track of all these payments coming
      out on different days and frequencies, sometimes even changing in amount
      based on usage. If you overspend and don't have enough money in your
      account you may go into overdraft where you create an unarranged temporary
      loan from the bank usually with very high interest and penalty fees. This
      is completely avoidable with a little bit of organisation.
    </p>
    <p>
      A similar issue is with credit cards, because they usually have something
      like 55 interest free days on purchases, you might end up in a situation
      where you overspend and when the credit card is due to be paid off you
      don't have enough funds so either your bank account goes into overdraft or
      you are left with a balance accruing interest. Again, this is completely
      avoidable.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Part 4: A Second Bank Account</h2>
    <p>
      How is it avoidable? Well, one approach is to always have a buffer in your
      bank account so regardless of when or how much is charged to it,
      everything gets paid on time without you having to do anything. This
      certainly reduces stress but you do run the risk of seeing a much higher
      balance and subconsciously thinking you have more money to spend than you
      actually have so you can still end up going through this buffer and
      spending money on movie tickets that should have gone towards the water
      bill the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      To avoid this, I propose having a second bank account into which you pay
      yourself an allowance for day to day spending. Crucially, only manual
      purchases should come from this account, with all automatically deducted
      expenses being covered by your first account. This way you can always see
      exactly how much you have left to spend and you will never need to worry
      that you are spending money needed for a bill because that is handled by a
      completely separate account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even with this system, you may still get your budget wrong or one month
      have a high bill for electricity for example so it is still advisable to
      keep a buffer here to keep everything running smoothly, a margin of error
      if you will.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Part 5: Losing Your Income</h2>
    <p>
      So far, this whole system has assumed that you will have an income coming
      in and that it is the same amount each month. For many people this is not
      the case, especially if you work an hourly job where your pay can
      fluctuate widely throughout the year or worse, you don't have any income
      at all for an extended period of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is where the concept of savings comes in. We have already been saving
      in our system by another name: buffers. So one approach to this would be
      to just increase this buffer to an amount where you can go for multiple
      months at a time or at least weather the ups and downs of a variable
      income.
    </p>
    <p>
      This however introduces the same problem as we had before whereby because
      we have a larger pile of money we are inclined to spend it down. It is
      possible that you spend all your buffer assuming your income will top it
      up but the income never comes.
    </p>
    <p>
      To avoid this risk, I propose having a third bank account with a few
      months worth of savings. In other words, an amount that you could live off
      of assuming you had no other income for that period. The account should be
      separate because it helps remind you to not dip into that money in normal
      circumstances, only when you have a dramatic reduction in income.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another benefit of having this amount set aside is that it acts as a
      cushion between you and debt. If you treat it right, you will have the
      peace of mind knowing that if all income stops you have a few months to
      find new employment or otherwise come up with a new plan without paying
      avoidable fees and interest.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Part 6: Save now, Pay Later</h2>
    <p>
      Sometimes you have expenses that are too large to cover with your normal
      spending allowance. For example, you might need to buy a car, want to go
      on a holiday or pay insurance once per year to get a discount. It would be
      annoying if every time one of these expenses comes up you then have to
      rein back your spending for that month just to stay in the budget,
      sometimes this may not be possible because it is an amount larger than a
      month's worth of spending.
    </p>
    <p>
      You could pay for this from your savings account from before but this
      would put you at risk if your income changes and the buffer in your first
      bank account is designed to protect you from overdrafts so where does this
      money come from?
    </p>
    <p>
      For many people the solution here is to put this purchase on debt of some
      kind, again incurring avoidable interest and fees. In recent years, buy
      now pay later schemes have attempted to solve this problem for consumers
      by spreading out this large sum over multiple payments.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you know that this expense is coming, especially something like a car
      registration or yearly insurance, why not plan ahead, putting money aside
      each month until the expenses comes up. To prevent confusion I propose
      having a fourth bank account for this purpose. You may even want to
      contribute more to this account than you expect your future expenses will
      be as a buffer in case that expense turns out to be higher than you
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, when that large expense comes up, you simply top up the account from
      which you pay for it and continue your spending as normal. This
      essentially smooths out a irregular expense to be a regular one. Instead
      of buy now, pay later you are saving now to pay later.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Part 7: Optimising</h2>
    <p>
      If you follow the advice given above including understanding your income,
      how frequently you get paid, what bank accounts to setup and leveraging
      buffers and savings to handle the fluctuations of life you, will be doing
      well. In fact, you may find yourself not really thinking about money on a
      daily or even weekly basis any more. Only checking up on your spending and
      making transfers for big purchases as they come along, everything else is
      automatic and stress free.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what if you want to do one better? All throughout this article we have
      developed a money system that avoids volatility, reduces banking admin and
      avoids unnecessary fees and interest. What if you could turn the tables
      and earn interest for how well you organise your finances?
    </p>
    <p>
      I propose you should have as many of your accounts be interest bearing as
      possible as long as they don't impede on your payments being made like
      withdrawal limits or minimum balance requirements.
