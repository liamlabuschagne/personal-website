        Inspired by <a href="https://www.yesigiveafig.com/p/part-1-my-life-is-a-lie">a US article claiming a poverty
            line of
            US$140k</a> (NZ$240) gross income for a family with two kids (this is the poverty line not comfortable).
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm interested in what this is in NZ assuming two income earners, two kids living in Onehunga.
    </p>
    <p>
        The IRD has their own <a
            href="https://www.ird.govt.nz/-/media/project/ir/home/documents/forms-and-guides/ir100---ir199/ad164/ad164-2025-may.pdf?modified=20250515232207&modified=20250515232207">Household
            Expenditure Guide</a> which you can compare to if you like.
    </p>
    <h2>Expenses</h2>
    <h3>Housing</h3>
    <p>
        <a
            href="https://www.tenancy.govt.nz/rent-bond-and-bills/market-rent/?location=Auckland+-+Onehunga&period=31&action_doSearchValues=Find+Rent">Tenancy
            Services rental data for Auckland - Onehunga</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm going to use rent as a convenient proxy for the total cost of home ownership (including maintenance,
        renovations
        and mortgage interest) especially since at the moment it is cheaper to rent.
        A 3 bedroom house in the lower quartile of rent in Auckland - Onehunga is $694/week.
    </p>
    <h3>Food</h3>
    <p>
        Food: $100-150 per person so $400-600 per week for a family of four.
    </p>
    <p>
        Based on <a
            href="https://www.naumainz.studywithnewzealand.govt.nz/studying-in-nz/before-your-arrival/cost-of-living">"Study
            with New Zealand" recommendations for potential students.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Another source could be the <a
            href="https://ourarchive.otago.ac.nz/esploro/outputs/report/Information-for-users-of-the-New/9926478644401891">Food
            Cost Survey from 2023</a> by University of Otago except this is already two years old. They also don't
        include
        any takeways at all. They estimate an Auckalnd family with two kids to be "Liberal" at $412 a week which seems
        quite
        low. I will take $500/week.
    </p>
    <h3>Transportation</h3>
    <p>
        Initially I calculated this based on <a href="https://www.ird.govt.nz/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/types-of-business-expenses/claiming-vehicle-expenses/kilometre-rates-2024-2025
https://www.ird.govt.nz/vehicle-expenses">IRD vehicle kilometer rates</a> for one car used the average kms per year so
        $315/week ($1.17 x 14,000km/year).
    </p>
    <p>
        Comparing this to other sources like the IRD Household Expenditure and <a
            href="https://www.stats.govt.nz/news/transport-expenditure-both-rises-and-falls-for-new-zealand-households/">2023
            Census data</a> I will adjust this downward to a more basic $250 per week.
    </p>
    <h3>Childcare</h3>
    <p>
        This is for holiday programmes during school holidays (both are 5+).</p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.education.govt.nz/school/school-terms-and-holiday-dates">NZ School Term Dates 2025</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.govt.nz/browse/work/public-holidays-and-work/public-holidays-and-anniversary-dates/">NZ
            Public
            Holidays</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.employment.govt.nz/leave-and-holidays/annual-holidays">NZ Annual Holidays</a> - 4 weeks
        annual
        leave (20 days).
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm only counting Monday-Friday since weekends you get off work anyway (typically), so therefore 5 days per
        school
        holiday week less any public holidays.
        Term 1 - 10 days less 3 public holidays so 7 days<br>
        Term 2 - 10 days<br>
        Term 3 - 10 days<br>
        Summer holidays = 6 weeks x 5 days = 30 days less 4 public holidays so 26 days <br>
        New Year's Day, Day after New Year's Day, Christmas Day, Boxing Day <br>
        <br>
        So total of 7 + 10 + 10 + 26 = 53 days annual leave <br>
        Each has 20 days AL so 40 total. 53 - 40 = 13 days childcare
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.moneyhub.co.nz/auckland-school-holiday-activities.html">Auckland School Holiday
            Activities</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Youthtown - $45 per child per full day - $90 per day for two kids <br>
        $90/day x 13 days required = $1,170 per year
    </p>
    <h3>Power</h3>
    <p>
        $3,063.06 per year or $58.91/week. <br>
        Based on data from MBIE <a href="https://www.mbie.govt.nz/assets/qsdep-report-15-August-2025.pdf">"Quarterly
            Survey
            of Domestic Electricity Prices"</a>
        <br>
        Based on 22kW per day or 8,000kW per year at 38.25c/kW or $3,063.06 per year
    </p>
    <h3>Rates</h3>
    <p>
        $78.25/week <br>
        Based on <a
            href="https://ourauckland.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/news/2025/08/council-rates-here-s-how-it-works/">Auckland
            Council latest average rates data.</a> <br>
        $4,069 per year for average property
    </p>
    <h3>Water</h3>
    <p>
        $25/week <br>
        <a
            href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/547500/auckland-water-charges-set-to-increase-7-point-2-percent-from-july">RNZ
            article talking about most recent Auckland water rates rise</a> <br>
        “From 1 July 2025, the price an average Auckland household pays for water and wastewater services would go up
        7.2
        percent or $7 a month.” so average must be $100/month
    </p>
    <h3>Internet</h3>
    <p>
        Based on a <a href="https://www.moneyhub.co.nz/compare-broadband.html">comparison on MoneyHub</a> 300 mbps is
        $90
        per month. You can get this down to about $60 per month for the most basic plan but this might not be enough for
        a
        family of four.
    </p>
    <h3>Phone Plan</h3>
    <p>
        Again, based on a <a href="https://www.moneyhub.co.nz/compare-mobile-plans.html">MoneyHhub comparison of mobile
            plans</a> Warehouse mobile $15 combo, just the parents need one each so $30 per 28 days = 13 months or $390
        annually = $7.50 per week
    </p>
    <h3>Home Contents Insurance</h3>
    <p>
        Based on a <a href="https://www.moneyhub.co.nz/contents-insurance.html">MoneyHub comparison of home contents
            insurance</a> this is $400 to $600 per year for $25,000 of total cover. I'll take the middle number of $500.
    </p>
    <h3>Life Insurance</h3>
    <p>
        Based on a <a href="https://www.moneyhub.co.nz/life-insurance.html">MoneyHub comparison of life insurances</a>
        <br>
        “30-year-olds: Around $400 annually for $500,000 cover”
        Sounds like it's usually just on one person's income (higher earner).
    </p>
    <h3>Other</h3>
    <p>
        Because more often than not when creating hypothetical budgets you underestimate your actual costs I'm going to
        add
        a blanket $100 a week as a margin of error.
    </p>
    <h2>Income</h2>
    <p>
        See the Google sheets for full calculation of <a
            href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fX5Tm09ElxVxbY2u85o1ZKiE2_jmd8wG_rJNnY5XJHM/edit?usp=sharing">my
            New Zealand Poverty Line</a>. <br> <br>
        My sheet estimates ~$92k per year of household expenses. If I round this up to $100k, under the most tax
        efficient situation where both earners are earning the same to achieve this after tax income they both need $50k
        after tax. I will assume they at least take the minimum 3% employer KiwiSaver match.
        <br>
        That is $63,830.56 before tax per earner or $127,661.12 total household income. <br>
        See <a href="https://regions.infometrics.co.nz/auckland/income-and-housing/household-income">InfoMetrics median
            household income data</a> <br>
        Compared to median household income in Auckland of $166k or $39k before tax more than the poverty line. Again,
        in the most tax efficient situation the household income is halved so $83,000 each or $61,856.40 after tax and
        KS. This is $11k per earner above the poverty line or $22k per household of savings/holiday money. <br>
        <br>
        For comparison the median household income in NZ is only $135k or $8k above the poverty line.
        <br>
        If we assume there is only one income earner the numbers work out like this: <br>
        To achieve the $100k poverty line: $144,196.23 <br>
        On $166k (median household income Auckland): $113,810.91 after tax (or $13k above poverty line) <br>
    </p>
    <h3>Family Tax Credits</h3>
    <p>
        See <a href="https://www.ird.govt.nz/working-for-families/types/family-tax-credit">the rules around family tax
            credits</a> <br>
        Eldest child: $7,524 <br>
        Every other child: $6,130 <br>
        Total: $13,654 <br>
        “We work out the abatement by starting with your family income, subtracting $42,700, then multiplying the
        difference by 27%. Your entitlement for the year will be your full family tax credit less the abatement.” <br>
        <br>
        $13,654/27% = $50,570.37 + $42,700 = $93,270.37 max income (no tax credit) <br>
        This is below my calculated poverty line of $127k-$144k <br>

        I don't think you'll get any other benefits based on that income. <br>
        <br>
        Interestingly, the max income where you get no benefits from Family Tax Credits lines up quite nicely with my
        estimate of the New Zealand poverty line.
    </p>
    <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
    <p>
        So on the whole, this simple anaylsis shows that it is indeed incredible expensive to live in New Zealand
        relative to the wages you receieve. <br>
        <br>
        It shows that in Auckland you need a household income of 76% of the median in Auckland or almost 100% of the
        national median household income to not be in poverty. That means across the country something like 50% of our
        households are realstically in poverty.<br>
        <br>
        This also assumes you have only two kids and that there is no extra money for savings or holidays or birthdays
        or any other random expenses. It is quite a bleak picture. Especially when you compare that to the good 'ol days
        when just one income earner was enough to afford not only a povery lifestyle but a comfortable one which
        incldued home ownership. <br>
        <br>
        Today to just reach the povery line on one income that is $144k gross income. Notable is that even though a big
        percentage of our population seems to be below or near the povery line we don't have very high childcare or
        healthcare costs which were really the two big killers in the US. In New Zealand that seems to be Housing and
        Food (and our petrol is at least 2x as expensive as the US).
