    <h1>Rent vs Buy</h1>
    <p>
      This article will be a growing collection of thoughts around the buy vs
      rent decision. Particularly in the context of New Zealand. This is
      motivated by the insane house prices which at least on the surface seem
      completely unattainable with normal incomes in this country without
      significant help from parents or doing something very abnormal to make it
      work.

    <h2>Buy Example</h2>
    <p>
      Firstly, I would like to run through an example on a real house in Te
      Awamutu and compare this with renting since it is local to me and feels
      the most simple to analyse.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.propertybrokers.co.nz/listing/TWU188624">Here</a> is
      the property in question and just in case the link stops working I'll
      include a screenshot of the listing and some basic details:
    </p>
    <img
      src="/public/img/blog/rent-vs-buy/37-laurie-street.png"
      alt="37 Laurie Street, Te Awamutu"
    />
    <p>
      This 1930's property has 3 internal bedrooms with self-contained granny
      flat in the backyard. The bathroom, laundry, and second toilet have been
      newly renovated but the kitchen is still original and the house has an
      awful green carpet throughout. Needless to say most people would want to
      do some work to it to make it nicer but its technically liveable as is.
    </p>
    <h3>Mortgage Calculator</h3>
    <p>
      I'm using the Co-Operative bank mortgage calculator with the following
      inputs:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Property price: $609,000</li>
      <li>Deposit: 20% ($121,800)</li>
      <li>Interest rate: 5.99% (current one year fixed)</li>
      <li>Term: 30 years</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Calculating Affordability</h3>
    <p>
      This gives us a weekly repayment of $670.59. How do we know this is
      affordable/good/bad? Based on a long-standing personal finance rule called
      the 28/36 rule your regular housing costs should not be more than 28% of
      your gross income. This includes mortgage payments, property taxes, and
      insurance and any other regular costs directly related to the mortgage.
      The 36% rule is the same but includes all debt payments (credit cards, buy
      now pay later, car debt etc).
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Weekly repayment: $670.59</li>
      <li>Affordability Rule: 28/36</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To give owning the best possible chance and to keep things simple, I'm
      going to exclude the costs of rates and insurance and assume we have no
      other debts. Therefore, working backwards from the mortgage payment we
      should be able to calculate what our gross-income needs to be to
      comfortably afford this mortgage.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gross yearly income needed: $124,880.28</li>
      <li>Multiplier: 186x weekly mortgage payment</li>
      <li>Equation: $670.59/7*365/28%</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      New Zealand has a progressive income tax system so I wanted to know how
      much this gross income would be after tax and especially how that compares
      to the mortgage payment.
      <a href="https://www.paye.net.nz/">PAYE.co.nz</a> is a great tool to
      calculate this since it includes not only income taxes but also ACC,
      KiwiSaver and student loan deductions if you have any and gives you the
      take home amount in any frequency you want.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>% of Net income (after PAYE, ACC): 38%</li>
      <li>% of Net income (after PAYE, ACC, KiwiSaver at 3%): 39.6%</li>
      <li>
        % of Net income (after PAYE, ACC, KiwiSaver at 3%, Student Loans): 45.9%
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      But what about on two incomes? The idea being that you would be less
      burdened by tax, each income only having to cover half the mortgage
      payment.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Repayment per income to cover: $335.30</li>
      <li>Required gross income each: $62,365.80</li>
      <li>% of Net income (after PAYE, ACC): 34.2%</li>
      <li>% of Net income (after PAYE, ACC, KiwiSaver at 3%): 35.5%</li>
      <li>
        % of Net income (after PAYE, ACC, KiwiSaver at 3%, Student Loans): 39.1%
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Buy Summary</h3>
    <p>
      So actually, on two incomes the affordability is not that much better,
      improving by 4-6% depending on your situation. Remembering that I have not
      included any of the other costs you would usually include in your regular
      housing expense to give the buy situation the best possible chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, I would argue that after tax, paying close to 40% of your income on
      purely the mortgage payment is insane. That means likely your basic
      housing cost will be over 50% before any groceries, petrol or other
      necessary expenses. Some might say that not all of this money is going
      toward interest and so some of it could be considered savings. This is
      true however based on the parameters you put in only in year 19 will you
      start to pay more in principal than interest. I used
      <a href="https://sorted.org.nz/tools/mortgage-calculator/"
        >sorted's mortgage repayment calculator</a
      >
      (which had a higher mortgage payment estimate by the way).
    </p>
    <p>
      If you limited your mortgage payment to only 25% of your net income, what
      would that look like?
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>After tax income required: $2,682.36 per week</li>
      <li>Gross income required (single): $209,000</li>
      <li>After tax per income (two): $1,341.18</li>
      <li>Gross income required (two): $96,000</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      How does this stack up to realistic incomes in NZ? According to
      <a
        href="https://www.stats.govt.nz/information-releases/labour-market-statistics-income-june-2024-quarter/"
        >Stats NZ</a
      >
      the median weekly income for June 2024 quarter was $1,343 or $70,027.86
      per year. A far cry from the $96,000 required to affordably buy this
      house. On top of this, we are considering a entry level house in a small
      town in the Waikato, making these types of incomes even less likely.

    <h2>Renting Example</h2>
    <p>
      OK, but you might retort, well it's still better than renting right? When
      you're renting you are just paying someone else's mortgage? Firstly, I
      want to dispel this myth on the basis logic. When you buy a meal at a
      restaurant no one ever complains that they're paying the restaurant
      owner's mortgage. In the same way that in the restaurant you are paying
      for a food service, when you rent you are getting a housing service with
      many conveniences not afforded to owners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, lets look at what you could rent with those same incomes spending
      the same amount on rent as you did on your mortgage (roughly 40%). To give
      renting the worst possible chance, I'm not going to add any allowances
      that represent the insurance and rates you would have to pay in the buy
      situation.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Available to spend on rent: $670.59</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I'm going to use
      <a href="https://www.trademe.co.nz/a/property/residential/rent"
        >TradeMe</a
      >
      to estimate the percentage of properties with 3 bedrooms in various areas
      that you could afford.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Waipa district: 11/26 (42%)</li>
      <li>Hamilton: 113/162 (70%)</li>
      <li>Auckland City: 180/653 (28%)</li>
      <li>North Shore City: 97/224 (43%)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Let's compare this to how many houses you could afford to buy in the same
      areas with $610,000.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Waipa District: 40/232 (17%)</li>
      <li>Hamilton: 111/481 (23%)</li>
      <li>Auckland City: 55/843 (6%)</li>
      <li>North Shore City: 16/553 (3%)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Renting Summary</h3>
    <p>
      So based on these numbers you have 2.5x, 3x, 4.7x and 14.3x times as many
      options in each area respectively when renting compared to buying if your
      only goal is to get somewhere to live. Having more options available and
      being more flexible means you are able to move for your job more easily,
      always only get as much house as you need for the time (single, married,
      with kids) and not have to deal with all the responsibilities that come
      with owning. If you only really need 2 bedrooms for example, your rent may
      come down by $100-200 a week which could be further invested or used for
      lifestyle expenses whilst when you own you are probably going to try to
      future proof the amount of space you need.

    <h2>Hidden Costs of Buying</h2>
    <p>
      On top of all this, most people do not buy a house and stay in it for 30
      years paying it off, they will move every couple years (<a
        href="https://www.corelogic.co.nz/news-research/news/2024/resale-profits-decline-as-buyer-bargaining-power-gains-momentum"
        >9.2 years according to some estimates</a
      >). Every time you do this you incur real estate fees, legal fees and
      potentially taxes. They will also usually take on some extra debt on the
      mortgage for renovations, holidays, buying a car, jet ski etc.
      Additionally, maintenance costs on old, affordable homes like the one in
      this example are much more than most people realise. For example replacing
      the roof would likely cost at least $20,000 with no value added to the
      property, it would be required to maintain its value and keep it
      sell-able.
    </p>
    <h3>Maintenance</h3>
    <p>
      Based on
      <a
        href="https://www.wisemove.co.nz/post/how-much-should-you-spend-on-home-maintenance-each-year"
      >
        a good rule of thumb of 1% for maintenance</a
      >
      and assuming no price appreciation of the house, this adds $6090 per year
      on top of your mortgage payment. Which is $117 per week.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Maintenance cost estimate rule: 1% of house value per year</li>
      <li>Per year maintenance (no price appreciation): $6090</li>
      <li>Maintenance cost per week: $117</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Adding this maintenance cost alone to your available amount for renting
      gives you $787 per week of budget which in Auckland city allows you to
      afford 290/653 (44%) 3 bedroom houses which is a 16% increase in options
      available to you.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      There are definitely some limitations with my analysis. I did not take
      into account the paper gains of owning a house nor compare that to renting
      and investing the difference. My general belief is that for every
      situation that you could own a home and make a return on it, you could
      find an equivalent renting situation and gain better returns by investing
      (this could even be investing in property by the way).

        >Opes Partners do a great video</a
      >
      that shows this in a simple way for the New Zealand context.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will also hazard a guess that for a large majority of people, owning
      their own home is much more of an emotional decision than it is a
      financial one and so none of these numbers will really change their minds
      which is totally fine. If you are not in that camp and would like to
      consider the financial impacts of buying a home in New Zealand my #1 take
      away for you is to
      <strong>RUN THE NUMBERS ON THE LARGEST PURCHASE OF YOUR LIFE</strong> as

      has become famous for saying. He doesn't own a house even though he is
      multi-millionaire, and he says the day he does buy a house, it will be the
      worst financial decision he ever made but it will have been worth it.
    </p>
    <p>
      What about me? Needless to say, I won't be buying a house any time soon
      and especially not in New Zealand, at least not as a primarily a place to
      live. This is mostly due to the fact that early on in my career I need to
      be flexible and be able to move to where the jobs are. Additionally, based
      on my current level of savings and income, it simply would not be viable
      to buy a house (the bank won't lend to me) so it's a pretty easy decision
      right now.
