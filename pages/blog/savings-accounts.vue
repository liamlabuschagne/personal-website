    <h2>What is a savings account?</h2>
    <p>
      Many people get confused about this surprisingly, conflating many types of
      financial accounts and investments as savings accounts when they aren't
      the same thing. Savings accounts are accounts offered by
      <a

        >non-bank deposit takers</a
      >
      that pay interest on your deposit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The money you put into these accounts are not invested into any other type
      of asset, they are simply held by the bank until such time that you want
      to withdraw it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean time banks can use the money to allow them to create more
      loans but this is quite a complex topic so I won't get any further into
      those mechanics here.
    </p>
    <p>
      This means that fundamentally, the only risk your money is exposed to is
      the risk of that bank failing and otherwise the value of your deposit will
      not fluctuate like other assets (other than earning interest on top of
      your original deposit).
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Types</h2>
    <p>
      The only difference between savings accounts are the interest rate you get
      and how restricted you are to withdrawing the funds. Generally, the more
      restrictive the account is, the more interest it will pay you for that
      commitment. This is because banks can then more easily plan on having a
      certain level of deposits.
    </p>
    <p>These are the three types of savings accounts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>On-call</li>
      <li>Notice</li>
      <li>Term Deposit</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      On-call means that you can withdraw the money at any time without notice.
      Some on-call savings accounts will have a bonus interest rate if you meet
      certain requirements like increasing the balance by $50 per month or not
      making any withdrawals. Sometimes banks will even charge you fees if you
      make too many withdrawals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice savings accounts are exactly the same but require to give a certain
      amount of notice like 30 or 90 days which practically means you initiate a
      withdrawal and choose a date for that withdrawal at least that far into
      the future. In the mean time you can continue to deposit money into it as
      normal and you will earn whatever the current interest rate is.
    </p>
    <p>
      A term deposit is the most restrictive where you actually lock in both the
      term and the interest rate. Because of this they generally have the
      highest interest rates available.
      <a
        href="https://bankomb.org.nz/guides-and-cases/quick-guides/savings-and-investment/breaking-a-term-deposit"
        >You have no protections under the law</a
      >
      to get access to this money early unless you come to an agreement with
      your bank, some banks have looser restrictions and regulations than
      others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of these types of accounts can be offered as a PIE (Portfolio
      Investment Entity) which is a tax structure originally created for
      KiwiSaver that essentially caps your tax rate at 28% (which is the company
      tax rate) so if you are in a higher personal income tax bracket you should
      seriously consider accounts with this tax structure.

    <h2>How much should I keep in savings?</h2>

    <p>
      Firstly, I'll say that as a general rule because the risk of savings
      accounts are very low (the value of your deposit doesn't change) you will
      on average be getting a lower return on your money than some kind of
      investment (who's value does fluctuate) because you are taking on more
      risk. This means you should actually try to minimise your how much you
      keep in "cash" (which are physical cash and bank deposits) because you are
      paying an opportunity cost as well as inflation eating away at the value
      of your money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Infact, interest rates are generally lower than the rate of inflation
      because central banks use this to stimulate or cool down the economy to
      keep inflation within an acceptable range. So you could argue that money
      kept in a savings account will on average always be loosing money to
      inflation and therefore should not be thought of as an investment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, your cash position should only be just enough to cover your day
      to day spending between paydays and some extra for unplanned expenses that
      may come up. Beyond this, you should only have more in savings if you are
      looking to use that money within a few years for say a house deposit. The
      rest should be invested to get a higher return.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only exception to this rule may be if you are entering retirement and
      are more interested in creating an income portfolio but again that is not
      the focus of this article and if you are unsure of anything you should
      seek financial advice for all matters especially retirement planning.

    <h2>How to choose a savings account?</h2>
    <p>
      If then we accept that savings accounts are not investments and are simply
      less bad than keeping money in a no-interest account or in cash, then it
      makes sense that we want to save our money in accounts with minimal
      restrictions and no fees (there is no reason to be paying fees on a
      savings account).
    </p>
    <p>
      This means that you should be looking for the highest interest rate you
      can get with the least restrictions. You can use comparison websites like
      <a href="https://www.interest.co.nz/saving/e-saver-online" target="_blank"
        >interest.co.nz</a
      >
      to compare the interest rates of different accounts.
    </p>

      with them.
